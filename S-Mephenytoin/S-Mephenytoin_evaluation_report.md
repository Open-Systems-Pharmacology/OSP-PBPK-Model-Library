# 1 Introduction
The presented PBPK model of S-mephenytoin has been developed to be used in a PBPK Drug-Drug-Interactions (DDI) network with S-mephenytoin as a substrate of CYP2C19.

Mephenytoin is a hydantoin-derivative anticonvulsant used to control various partial seizures and was first used in the 1940s ([Troupin 1979](#5-references)).

Only limited clinical PK and ADME data are available. Mephenytoin is soluble and rapidly absorbed with a Tmax of 1 hour. The mean half-life in human is 6.8 hours. No hints for dose non-linearity could be found in literature.

Mephenytoin is the mixture of the two enantiomers S- and R-Mephenytoin. S-Mephenytoin is mainly metabolized via CYP2C19. Only a very minor part is metabolized by CYP2C9. The R-enantiomer is not metabolized by CYP2C19. The clearance of S-Mephenytoin in CYP2C19 EM is 40 to 100-fold higher than in PM.

# 2 Methods


## 2.1 Modeling Strategy
The general workflow for building an adult PBPK model has been described by Kuepfer et al. ([Kuepfer 2016](#5-references)). Relevant information on the anthropometry (height, weight) was gathered from the respective clinical study, if reported. Information on physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, hematocrit) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been incorporated in PK-Sim® as described previously ([Willmann 2007](#5-references)). The  applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim® are described in the publicly available 'PK-Sim® Ontogeny Database Version 7.3' ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](#5-references)).

Only the  S-enantiomer of mephenytoin is modeled. The modeling work flow can be summarized as following:

| **Modelling step**                                           | **Data used / comment**                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1.) Development of mean po model (no i.v. data  available)** | IVIVE based on physico-chemistry and in vitro  metabolization or recalculated in vivo clearance.  Alternative middle out fits to in vivo data were tried but could not improve DDI prediction significantly. Additional limited data lead to identifiability problems. |
| **2.) Evaluation of p.o. model with virtual PK-Sim  population** | Range and mean plasma profiles after p.o. administration for the study population was in line with the PK-Sim in-built variability of  CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. |

The predefined “Standard European Male for DDI” individual was used (age = 30 y, weight = 73 kg, height = 176 cm, BMI = 23.57 kg/m2). CYP2C19 expression from the PK-Sim in-built RT-PCR database was added.

Due to the limited data, an IVIVE approach has been selected. Parameters describing intrinsic CYP2C19 clearance were recalculated from CL/F ([Adedoyin 1998](#5-references)) and in vitro metabolism data from human microsomes CYP2C19 clearance and CYP2C9 clearance ([Steere 2015](#5-references)).

A simulation of a population with 2000 virtual individuals according to the biometrics of the individuals (8 males and females, 32-78 years) used in a study by [Adedoyin 1998](#5-references) was carried out. Additional variability was included on CYP2C19 among the population, by using the geometric SD as derived from reported CL/F values in [Olivares-Morales 2016](#5-references).

Details about input data (physicochemical, *in vitro* and clinical) can be found in [Section 2.2](#22-data).

Details about the structural model and its parameters can be found in [Section 2.3](#23-model-parameters-and-assumptions).

## 2.3 Model Parameters and Assumptions
### 2.3.1 Absorption

Intestinal permeability is calculated by PK-Sim. No data are available to estimate the parameter.

### 2.3.2 Distribution

Partition coefficient calculation by `Rodgers and Rowland` and cellular permeability calculation by `PK-Sim Standard` have been assumed. Identification of the best suited calculation methods was not possible due to lack of i.v. data.

### 2.3.3 Metabolism and Elimination

Two linear metabolic pathways for S-mephenytoin were implement in the model:

* CYP2C19
* CYP2C9

Additionally, glomerular filtration was implemented with assumed GFR fraction of 1. No active renal excretion described in literature. Renal clearance is minor compared to overall plasma clearance ([Jacqz 1986](#5-references)) and can be described by glomerular filtration.

### 2.3.5 Automated Parameter Identification

Performing parameter identification on lipophilicity, CYP2C19 intrinsic clearance, and intestinal permeability did not improve the performance of the model. Therefore, no parameters have been estimated.

# 3 Results and Discussion
The next sections show:

1. Final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-final-input-parameters).
2. Overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-diagnostics-plots).
3. Simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).

## 3.1 Final input parameters
The parameter values of the final PBPK model are illustrated below.

# 4 Conclusion
A PBPK model describing the limited set of in vivo p.o. data could be established.

Population simulated data had a comparable variability with the observed data when included additional variability for CYP2C19 expression. Moreover, the mean data from other studies ([Jacqz 1986](#5-references), [Wedlund 1985](#5-references)) were in the range of expected variability, confirming the adequacy of the model.
