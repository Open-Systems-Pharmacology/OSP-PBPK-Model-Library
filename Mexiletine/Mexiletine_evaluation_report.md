# 1 Introduction
The presented PBPK model of mexiletine has been developed to be used in a PBPK Drug-Drug-Interactions (DDI) network with mexiletine as a substrate and inhibitor of CYP1A2.

Mexiletine is a non-selective voltage-gated sodium channel blocker which belongs to the Class IB anti-arrhythmic group of medicines. It is used to treat arrhythmias within the heart, or seriously irregular heartbeats. The following ADME properties characterize mexiletine pharmacokinetics ([Mexiletine Drugs.com](#5-references), [SmPC Namuscla](#5-references)):

**Absorption**: Mexiletine is well absorbed (~90%) from the gastrointestinal tract. Its first-pass metabolism is low. Peak blood levels are reached in two to three hours.

**Distribution**: It is 50% to 60% bound to plasma protein, with a volume of distribution of 5 to 7 l/kg.

**Metabolism**: Mexiletine is mainly metabolized in the liver, the primary pathway being CYP2D6 metabolism, although it is also a substrate for CYP1A2. With involvement of CYP2D6, there can be either poor or extensive metabolizer phenotypes. The metabolic degradation proceeds via various pathways including aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation, dealkylation, deamination and N-oxidation. Several of the resulting metabolites are submitted to further conjugation with glucuronic acid (phase II metabolism); among these are the major metabolites p-hydroxyMexiletine, hydroxy-methylMexiletine, and N-hydroxy-Mexiletine.

**Elimination**: In normal subjects, the plasma elimination half-life of mexiletine is approximately 10 to 12 hours. Approximately 10% is excreted unchanged by the kidney.

After i.v. administration, mexiletine shows linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range 167-200 mg (free base) and healthy volunteers and patients show similar profiles. p.o. data appear dose linear in the range of 83-500 mg as free base. The summary of product characteristics (SPC) for mexiletine ([Mexiletine, Drugs.com](#5-references)) reports that absorption rate of mexiletine is reduced in clinical situations such as acute myocardial infarction in which gastric emptying time is increased. For this reason, clinical data from patients after p.o. administration have not been considered during model development.


# 2 Methods


## 2.1 Modeling Strategy
The general workflow for building an adult PBPK model has been described by Kuepfer et al. ([Kuepfer 2016](#5-references)). Relevant information on the anthropometry (height, weight) was gathered from the respective clinical study, if reported. Information on physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, hematocrit) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been incorporated in PK-Sim® as described previously ([Willmann 2007](#5-references)). The  applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim® are described in the publicly available 'PK-Sim® Ontogeny Database Version 7.3' ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](#5-references)).

A stepwise approach was used to fit the model to data.

1. Define distribution model, cellular permeability, renal and metabolic clearance on data after single i.v. administration. For this purpose, literature values from [Mexiletine, Drugs.com](#5-references) were derived for renal CL and CYP2D6 combined with CYP1A2 metabolic clearance, or total hepatic CL, fitted against the data.

2. Define intestinal permeability and fraction absorbed by fitting the model against data after p.o. single dose administration ([Pringle 1986](#5-references)). Investigate multiple oral doses predictions in CYP2D6 extensive and poor metabolizers ([Labbé 2000](#5-references)).

The predefined “Standard European Male for DDI” individual (age = 30 y, weight = 73 kg, height = 176 cm, BMI = 23.57 kg/m2) with added CYP2D6 expression obtained from PK-Sim RT PCR database was used if not stated otherwise. For simulations of Japanese subjects ([Kusumoto 1998](#5-references)), a typical Japanese individual (age = 30 y, weight = 61.87 kg, height = 168.99 cm, BMI = 21.67 kg/m2) was created in PK-Sim from predefined database “Japanese (2015)” by adding CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 expression from PK-Sim RT PCR database.

For simulations of CYP2D6 PM, the CYP2D6 pathway has been switched off.

Population simulation of single 83 mg p.o. administration was conducted to visually compare the predicted concentration-time profiles to the observed concentrations reported in the literature, in terms of mean and variability. A population of 1000 male individuals was generated based on “Standard European Male for DDI”. Age range was limited to 20-40 years.

Details about input data (physicochemical, *in vitro* and clinical) can be found in [Section 2.2](#22-data).

Details about the structural model and its parameters can be found in [Section 2.3](#23-model-parameters-and-assumptions).

## 2.3 Model Parameters and Assumptions
### 2.3.1 Absorption

Gastrointestinal permeability was fitted to concentration data after single dose oral administration.

The default dissolution Weibull profile (`Dissolution time (50% dissolved)` = 60min, `Dissolution shape` = 0.92) was used for description of formulation.

### 2.3.2 Distribution

Physico-chemical parameters were set to the reported values (see [Section 2.2.1](#221-in-vitro-and-physico-chemical-data)). It was assumed that the major binding partner in plasma is albumin.

Because mexiletine is a strong base, permeation across the barriers between interstitial space and intracellular space (cellular permeability) had to be adjusted manually, as only uncharged molecules can pass through membranes, which is not accounted for by the permeability calculated by PK-Sim. The parameters `Specific organ permeability` and `Lipophilicity` defining the distribution in tissues were fitted to i.v. data.

After testing the available organ-plasma partition coefficient and cell permeability calculation methods available in PK-Sim, observed clinical data were best described by choosing the partition coefficient calculation by `Rodgers and Rowland` and cellular permeability calculation by `PK-Sim Standard`.

### 2.3.3 Metabolism and Elimination

Following metabolization and elimination processes are implemented:

- Linear CYP1A2, with specific clearance set to 28.6% of estimated total Liver Plasma Clearance (according to [Labbé 2000](#5-references))
- Linear CYP2D6, with specific clearance set to 37.1% of estimated total Liver Plasma Clearance (according to [Labbé 2000](#5-references))
- Liver plasma clearance,  with specific clearance set to 34.3% of estimated total Liver Plasma Clearance (according to [Labbé 2000](#5-references))
- Kidney plasma clearance with plasma clearance value set to reported value (see [Section 2.2.1](#221-in-vitro-and-physico-chemical-data))

The model has been developed with kidney and liver plasma clearances only, without separating between the different enzymes. The parameter `Specific clearance` of the total hepatic clearance was estimated by fitting the model to observed data (see [Section 2.2.2](#222-clinical-data)). The parameters `Specific clearance` of the linear CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 metabolization processes have been calculated from from the total hepatic clearance by multiplying the identified total hepatic clearance by the reported percentage contribution of the respective enzyme and dividing by the `Reference concentration` of the respective enzyme as given by the PK-Sim database (1.8 µmol/l for CYP1A2 and 0.4 µmol/l for CYP2D6). This is necessary as the `Specific clearance` is multiplied by the concentration of the enzymes in the respective organ, with reference concentration of the dummy enzyme used in the total hepatic clearance being 1 µmol/l per default. With the applied parameter values, CYP1A2 in the liver is responsible for 25% of total mexiletine metabolization, while CYP2D6 in the liver is responsible for 33% of total metabolization. Additional metabolization by CYP2D6 takes place in intestinal mucosa, though to a minor extent.

### 2.3.4 Automated Parameter Identification

Following parameter values were estimated for the model:

- `Specific clearance` (Total hepatic clearance)
- `Specific organ permeability`
- `Lipophilicity`
- `Plasma clearance` of total Liver Plasma Clearance (divided between three processes in final model)
- `Intestinal permeability (transcellular)`

# 4 Conclusion
The PBPK model developed for mexiletine was able to accurately predict the time-profiles following i.v. and p.o. dosing of mexiletine in EM and PM phenotypes. Observed variability was generally larger than the predicted in population simulations. Depending on study population, smoking status or variation in CYP-phenotypes may lead to additional variability which might be not included in the PK-Sim ontogeny factor.

The predicted fraction excreted in urine was similar to the fraction reported in the label (9% vs 10%). The predicted bioavailability was 85%, compared to the observed as per label of 90%.
